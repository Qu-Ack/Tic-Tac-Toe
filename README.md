# Tic-Tac-Toe

In This project we will try to use modules and factory functions as much as possible and try to make our code organised and easy to read. We will follow certain steps after each steps we will commit our progress to git. 

As Always we will not focus on styling that much but more on javascript fundamentals.We are learning something new with every project that we do and I hope this continues that way.
